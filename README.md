I am a data scientist with a background in accounting who helps organizations identify and use untapped resources. With my unique set of analytical and organizational skills, I discover new opportunities, root out waste, capture lessons and organize knowledge. I am motivated by the thrill of discovery using a mix of innovative and tried-and-true approaches to problem solving.

### Projects Iâ€™m currently working on :love_letter: ***and*** Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ðŸ‘¯

**Art consulting app**
* **Match art collectors with visual artists.** Build off of existing artwork libraries and open source software to create an artist / artwork recommender system for collectors.The points of differentiation would include the following added context layers:

    *  **Interior design scheme in the collectorsâ€™ homes**: How the art pieces could coordinate with the existing scheme or inform the interior design process
    * **Artist career status**: Use weightings scale for emerging artists and established artists with an oeuvre (body of work) size consistent with mid-career as well as late-career artists. In the case that a collector wants to focus on supporting emerging artists, the weighting would favor them in the algorithm.
    * **Collecting principles**: Do the collectorsâ€™ collecting strategy focus on art as an investment class and secondary market sellability (at auction houses, for example), or the pure love of art, or a mix? Do they favor a single genre or a multi-genre grab-bag that then needs to be shaped into a cohesive whole?
